// Proposed: (btw i have no idea what most of these mean theyre just what chatgpt recommended we check out)
// Geometric Mean Magnitude Morph
// Envelope Cross-Deformation (spectral energy of output with formant curvature of input)
// Spectral Warping Morph (map formant shifts and warp smoothly)
// Morph that emphasizes phase coherence, really blending two signals
// Distribution Morph (magnitudes are probability distributions, interpolate via Earth Mover's Distance)
// Noise-Tone Decomposition Morph (morph tonal and residual components separately)
// Spectral Contrast Morph (extract "contrast" and interpolate contrast instead of magnitudes)
// Iterative Projection Morph (project into shared manifold, nmf or pca, and interpolate in that space)
//    Spectral Topology Morph (get each partial's features and morph on shortest path between manifolds)
//    Optimal Transport Morph (treat magnitudes as mass distributions, wasserstein barycenter to morph)
//    Laplacian Morph (construct graph laplacians and interpolate)
// Spectral Entropy Morph (low entropy bins emphasize one, high entropy bins emphasize another, morph adapts to signal character)
